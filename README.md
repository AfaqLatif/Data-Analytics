# Data-Analytics
I create an Ecommerce sales dashboard with sales data that is responsive with respect to product category.

1. Comparison between month-wise sales and profit.
2. Region-wise sales.
3. A line chart that shows trend of month-wise sales.
4. Distribution of aging.
5. Total sales of particular product category.
6. Total profit of particular product category.
7. Total quantities sold  of particular product category.

There are many ways to build a dashboard and also make it responsive:
1. With formulas
2. By using Pivot tables

But in this project, i built and made it responsive with formulas.
